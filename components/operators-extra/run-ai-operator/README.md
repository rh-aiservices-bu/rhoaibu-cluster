# Run:AI

Install Run:AI.

Do not use the `base` directory directly, as you will need to patch the `channel` based on the version of OpenShift you are using, or the version of the operator you want to use.

The current *overlays* available are for the following channels:

* [fast](overlays/fast)
* [preview](overlays/preview)
* [stable](overlays/stable)
