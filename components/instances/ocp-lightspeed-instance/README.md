## Configures the operator for OpenShift LightSpeed.

At present, it is powered by Model as a Service (MaaS), but the credentials are in the same namespace with the name `credentials` and the value `apitoken`.

There is one MaaS application for Dev RHOAIBU Cluster(rhoaibu-cluster-dev-ocp-lightspeed-mistral) and one for Prod RHOAIBU Cluster (rhoaibu-cluster-prod-ocp-lightspeed-mistral).

TODO: set up SealedSecrets and configure the credentials.
